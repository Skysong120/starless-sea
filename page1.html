                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>Far beneath the surface of the earth, upon the shores of the Starless Sea,
                        there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories.
                        The entryways that lead to this sanctuary are often hidden, but those who seek will find.
                        Their doors have been waiting for them. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is searching for his door,
                        though he does not know it. When he discovers a mysterious book in the stacks of his campus library,
                        he begins to read and is entranced. Suddenly, a turn of the page brings Zachary to a story from his own childhood.
                        A bee, a key, and a sword emblazoned on the book lead Zachary to two people who will change the course of his life:
                        Mirabel, a fierce, pink-hairder painter, and Dorian, a handsome barefoot man with shifting alliances.</p>
                    <p>Amid twisting tunnels filled with books, gilded ballrooms, and wine-dark shores, Zachary falls into an intoxicating world
                        soaked in romance and mystery. But a battle is raging over the fate of this place, and though there are those who would
                        willingly sacrifice everything to protect it, there are just as many intent on its destruction. As Zachary, Mirabel,
                        and Dorian venture deeper into the space and its histories and myths, searching for answers and one another,
                        a timeless story unspools, casting a spell of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a Starless Sea.</p>

                        "Morgenstern has created the ultimate ode to storytelling.... She beautifully crafts an imaginary world with such
                        vivid, delicate detail that you can't help but feel like it truly could exist."

                        "A sprawling, ambitious spell of a story.... The journey is nothing short of magical, like a fantastical, delirious dream that makes
                        awakening back to reality a disappointment. Set aside a few quiet hours to devour this opulent feast."
